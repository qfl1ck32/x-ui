This bundle is a set of tools allowing you to do beautiful frontends. Using the X-Framework.

## Install

You can easily create it by running `x`, choose `microservice`, and select `frontend`.

```bash
npm i @kaviar/x-ui @apollo/client
npm i react react-dom react-router-dom
```

## Setup

We begin by defining our kernel, and our initial bundle

```tsx title="kernel.ts"
import { Kernel } from "@kaviar/core";
import { XUIBundle } from "@kaviar/x-ui";
import { UIAppBundle } from "{...}/UIAppBundle";

// All UI bundles need to be prefixed with UI
// All X-Framework bundles have the first prefix X
export const kernel = new Kernel({
  bundles: [
    new XUIBundle({
      graphql: {
        // ApolloClient Options
        // https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/core/ApolloClient/#ApolloClientOptions
        uri: process.env.REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_URI,
      },
    }),
    new UIAppBundle(),
  ],
});
```

Now create a sample `UIAppBundle`, and we ask it to load the routes.

```ts
import { Bundle } from "@kaviar/core";

export class UIAppBundle extends Bundle {}
```

And now we can finally render.

```tsx
import { kernel } from "./kernel";
import { XUIProvider } from "@kaviar/x-ui";
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

ReactDOM.render(
  <XUIProvider kernel={kernel} />,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

## Routing

We add routes through the `XRouter`. Routes are added programatically. Behind the scenes we use `react-router-dom` .

```tsx
import { Bundle } from "@kaviar/core";

export class UIAppBundle extends Bundle {
  async init() {
    const router = this.container.get(XRouter);

    router.add({
      HOME: {
        path: "/",
        component: () => <h1>Hello world!</h1>,
        // All other properties from react-router-dom can be added here
      },
    });
  }
}
```

Our strong recommendation is to never rely on strings for routes, this is why we'll add them in a route map and use it like this:

```ts title="routes.ts"
export const HOME = {
  path: "/",
  component: () => <h1>Hello world!</h1>,
};

export const USER_VIEW = {
  path: "/users/:_id",
  // Route parameters are injected in the component's props
  component: ({ _id }) => <h1>Hello user {_id}!</h1>,
};

export const SEARCH = {
  path: "/search",
  // Query variables (/search?q=something), are all injected inside `queryVariables` property
  component: ({ queryVariables }) => (
    <h1>You are searching {queryVariables.q}</h1>
  ),
};
```

And now simply add them in your bundle like this:

```ts
import * as Routes from "./routes";

// The function from the Bundle
class UIAppBundle extends Bundle {
  async init() {
    const router = this.container.get(XRouter);

    router.add(Routes);
  }
}
```

Using the link and generating it:

```tsx
import { useRouter } from "@kaviar/x-ui";
import * as Routes from "{path}/routes.ts";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

function Component() {
  // router.path gets you the path
  // router.go also pushes it to history

  const router = useRouter();
  return (
    <div>
      <Link to={router.path(HOME)}>Home Link</Link>
      <button onClick={() => router.go(HOME)}>Take me home</button>
      <Link to={router.path(USER_VIEW, { params: { _id: "123" } })}>
        Parameter Login
      </Link>
      <Link to={router.path(SEARCH, { query: { q: "value" } })}>Home Link</Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Authorisation

The routes also support a `roles: []` option:

```ts
export const PROTECTED_VIEW = {
  path: "/users/:_id",
  component: ({ _id }) => <h1>Hello user {_id}!</h1>,
  // Ensure that each user returns the 'USER' in the roles request. This basically says: you are logged in.
  roles: ["USER"],
};
```

An alternative would be to `useGuardian()` and check for the role.

If the user doesn't have the role we render the `NotAuthorized` component. Which can be overridden.

## Dependency Injection

We have succcesfully blended D.I. with React. The concept is easy, you control your container inside the `prepare()` or `init()` phase of a bundle, you use it inside React. The right container is properly passed because everything is wrapped in `<XUIProvider />`.

```ts
import { useContainer, useRouter, use } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

class A {}

function Component() {
  const container = useContainer();
  // You fetch the singleton instance of A
  const a = use(A);
  // Just like we used router above
  const router = useRouter();
}
```

## GraphQL

We use `@apollo/client` so in theory, all you have to do is just use it. You can [follow the official guideline here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react/hooks/), they will work outside the box without changing anything.

```tsx
import { ApolloClient } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

function Component() {
  // Note, that we implement our own ApolloClient which extends the base one, so we can properly create the links and everything
  const apolloClient = use(ApolloClient);
}
```

## Collections

Collections are an interface to your remote database via `GraphQL` as long as the remote queries and mutations respect a specific interface. That interface you get it in a snap when you create a `GraphQL CRUD` from the cli command `x`.

```ts
import { Collection } from "@kaviar/x-ui";
import { Post } from "./Post.model";

export class Post {
  _id: any;
  title: string;
  isApproved: boolean;
}

export class PostsCollection extends Collection<Post> {
  getName() {
    // This is the endpoint name of the crud
    // Queries: postsFind, postsFindOne, postsCount
    // Mutations: postsInsertOne, postsUpdateOne, postsDeleteOne
    return "posts";
  }
}
```

### Queries

Below, we'll have a simple example how to use the posts collection to find data.

```tsx
function Component() {
  const postsCollection = use(PostsCollection);

  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    postsCollection
      .find(
        {},
        {
          // We specify which fields to use
          _id: 1,
          title: 1,
        }
      )
      .then((posts) => setPosts(posts));
  });

  // Render them somehow
}
```

Queries support both MongoDB filters and options:

```ts
postsCollection.find(
  {
    filters: {
      isApproved: true,
    },
    options: {
      sort: {
        createdAt: -1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    _id: 1,
    title: 1,
  }
);
// The request can span-out on many lines, sometimes it's good to define them outside a component
```

We also support relational data, if relations are defined with `Nova` in the backend:

```ts
postsCollection.find(
  {},
  {
    _id: 1,
    title: 1,
    author: {
      name: 1,
    },
  }
);
```

We also support filtering the subset of relations:

```ts
// This sideBody will get merged on the backend, and is sent via options field.
const sideBody = {
  comments: {
    // This will only fetch the last 5 comments
    $: {
      options: {
        sort: { createdAt: -1 },
        limit: 5,
      },
    },
  },
};

postsCollection.find(
  {
    sideBody,
  },
  {
    _id: 1,
    title: 1,
    comments: {
      name: 1,
    },
  }
);
```

Relational sorting means that you're sorting your current set, by a relation's field. For example you're listing all employees, and you want them sorted by company's name:

```ts
employeesCollection.find(
  {
    options: {
      sort: {
        "company.name": 1,
      },
    },
  },
  {
    name: 1,
    company: {
      name: 1,
    },
  }
);
```

You can also find a single document with filters or by \_id:

```ts
let post;
post = postsCollection.findOne({ _id: postId }, { title: 1 });
// Equivallence
post = postsCollection.findOneById(postId, { title: 1 });
```

Counting documents is also easy:

```ts
postsCollection.count(filters).then((count) => {});
```

### Transformers

This will transform the fetched result however you prefer, you can either instantiate a class with it using something like `class-transformers` package, or just modify certain fields.

What we normally recommend is do this for `_id` which are `ObjectId` and to transform numbers to `Date` for fields which are dates. Note it will only perform transformation if the response is not `undefined`.

```ts
import { ObjectId } from "@kaviar/ejson";

class PostsCollection extends Collection<Post> {
  getTransformMap() {
    return {
      _id: (v) => new ObjectId(v),
      tagIds: (v) => v.map((v) => new ObjectId()),
      createdAt: (v) => new Date(v),
    };
  }
}
```

To be able to perform deep transformation when fetching elements with relations, we need to define the links:

```ts
class PostsCollection extends Collection<Post> {
  getLinks() {
    return [
      {
        name: "tags",
        collection: () => TagsCollection,
        many: true, // use false or omit for single relationships
        field: "tagIds", // if you are dealing with an inversed relationship
      },
    ];
  }
}
```

### Mutations

We have made the decision to not allow multi document updates or insertions due to security concerns. This is why we can only insert a single document, update document by \_id, and remove it also by \_id:

```ts
postsCollection
  .insertOne({
    title: 1,
    userId: "USER_ID",
  })
  .then(({ _id }) => {
    // Do something with the newly created _id
  });

postsCollection
  .updateOne(postId, {
    $set: {
      title: "New Title",
    },
  })
  .then(() => {
    // Do something after updating it
  });

postsCollection.deleteOne(postId).then(() => {
  // Do something after deleting it
});
```

### Extending Collections

If you want to add additional collection specific logic, it would be advisable to put it in the class itself. This would allow you to re-use the code as you need it.

```ts
class PostsCollection extends Collection<Post> {
  findAllApprovedPosts(): Promise<Post[]> {
    // You have access to apolloClient inside it
    return this.apolloClient
      .query({
        query: gql`...`,
        variables: {},
      })
      .then((response) => {
        return response.data.queryName;
      });
  }
}
```

### Hooks

Integration with React is seamless and painless:

```tsx
import { useData, useLiveData, useDataOne, useLiveDataOne } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

function PostsList() {
  const {
    data: posts,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useData(
    PostsCollection,
    {
      // Query options
      filters: {},
      options: {},
    },
    {
      // The request body
      _id: 1,
      title: 1,
      comments: {
        text: 1,
      },
    }
  );
  // render the posts
}
```

If you are expecting a single post, we also have an easy find by \_id solution:

```tsx
const {
  data: post,
  isLoading,
  error,
} = useDataOne(PostsCollection, new ObjectId(props.id), body);
```

## Live Data

If you want to use the smart live data, just swap `useData()` with `useLiveData()` and it will magically work, your data will be listening to changes.

```ts
import { useLiveData } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

const LiveDataPage = () => {
  const {
    data: posts,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useLiveData(
    PostsCollection,
    {
      filters: {},
      options: {},
    },
    requestBody
  );

  // or single element
  const {
    data: post,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useLiveDataOne(PostsCollection, new ObjectId(id), requestBody);
};
```

You can also hook into the events, via the 4th argument, options:

```ts
useLiveData(collectionClass, options, body, {
  onReady() {
    // Do something when all data has been initially loaded
  },
  onError(error: Error) {
    // Handle if subscription throws out an error
  },
  onChanged(document, changeSet, previousDocument) {
    // Do something when something about the subscription changes
  },
  onRemoved(document) {
    // Do something when document is removed
  },
  onAdded(document) {
    // Do something when document is added
  },
});
```

:::caution
When using live data and relations, it is by design to not have reactivity at nested levels. For example if someone updates the comments' text it won't trigger a reactive change. Instead you will have to create separate component that subscribes to that comment via `useLiveData()`.
:::

## Integration with Smart

Smart is a very small library that does state management by using `useState()` from React and `useContext()` allowing you to easily split logic out of your components.

The difference here is that `Smart` from this package, allows you to work with the D.I. container:

```ts
import { Smart, useSmart, newSmart } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

class MySmart extends Smart<any, any> {
  @Inject()
  eventManager: EventManager;
}

function Component() {
  const [mySmart, Provider] = newSmart(MySmart);

  // mySmart has been instantiated by the container, seemlessly
}
```

## Lists

We have created a `Smart` that allows you to easily work with lists:

```ts title="PostListSmart.ts"
import { ListSmart } from "@kaviar/x-ui";
import React from "react";
import { Post, PostsCollection } from "../../collections";

const PostsListContext = React.createContext(null);
export class PostsListSmart extends ListSmart<Post> {
  collectionClass = PostsCollection;

  body = {
    // You have all the benefits of the Nova body we've seen in Collections
    // If you have a custom prop-based body you can pass it via config when doing `newSmart()`
    _id: 1,
    title: 1,
    user: {
      name: 1,
    },
  };

  static getContext() {
    return PostsListContext;
  }
}
```

Now we can use it in our components:

```ts
function Component() {
  const [api, Provider] = newSmart(PostsList, {
    perPage: 5, // optional pagination
    filters: {}, // initial filters that can't be overriden
    sort: {
      createdAt: -1,
    },
  });
}
```

Now you can access `api.state` from within `Component` or via `api = useSmart(PostsList)` in deeply nested children:

```ts
// This is how the state looks like:
export type ListState<T = any> = {
  isLoading: boolean;
  isError: boolean;
  isCountLoading: boolean;
  isCountError: boolean;
  documents: T[];
  filters: MongoFilterQuery<T>;
  options: IQueryOptions<T>;
  currentPage: number;
  perPage: null | number;
  totalCount: number;
  errorMessage: string;
  countErrorMessage: string;
};
```

So you have acces to nice things now you will most likely play with:

```ts
api.setFilters({
  title: new RegExp("{value from a search field}", "i"),
});

api.updateSort({
  title: 1, // After let's say he clicks a table
});
```

## Guardian

The guardian is a smart that communicates with the server, providing authentication methods for `register`, `login`, `logout`, `changePassword`, `forgotPassword`, resetPassword, verify email.

Explore the examples [in this boilerplate](https://githubs1.com/kaviarjs/x-boilerplate/tree/main/microservices/ui/src/bundles/UIAppBundle/pages/Authentication)

It also handles fetching the user data using the `me` standard query, but this behavior can be later changed.

Basic usage:

```tsx
function Component() {
  const guardian = useGuardian();
  const router = useRouter();

  onLogin = () {
    guardian.login("username", "password").then(result => {
      router.go(HOME)
    })
  }
}
```

Let's use guardian in our components

```tsx
function TopBar() {
  const guardian = useGuardian();

  const {
    // This happens on first page load, if the Guardian has finished reading the token and fetching the user (if exists)
    initialised,
    isLoggedIn,
    // This happens when Guardian initialises and the stored token has expired and can no longer be used
    hasInvalidToken,
    // This is true after logging in, or when initialising we fetch the user via me() query
    // This gets false after the me() query has returned or errored
    fetchingUserData,
    user,
  } = guardian.state;

  // In this realm the component will re-render automatically if the user logs in, just use the variables from state.

  // it checks for roles: []
  const isAdmin = guardian.hasRole(Roles.ADMIN);
}
```

The user type is the default one from `XPasswordBundle`:

```ts
type GuardianUserType = {
  _id: string | object | number;
  profile: {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
  };
  roles: string[];
  email: string;
};
```

### Extending the Guardian

There are several reasons you would want to extend the guardian, most popular being

1. Change registration input
2. Fetch different set of data of the logged in user

```ts
import {
  GuardianSmart,
  GuardianUserType,
  GuardianUserRegistrationType,
} from "@kaviar/x-ui";

// configure your types, optionally extend the default guardian user types we imported
const AppUserType =
  GuardianUserType &
  {
    profile: {
      fullName: string,
      gamerScore: number,
    },
  };

class AppGuardianSmart extends GuardianSmart<AppUserType, AppRegistrationType> {
  retrieveUser(): Promise<AppUserType> {
    // you have access to this.authenticationToken
    this.apolloClient
      .query({
        // custom query
      })
      .then((response) => {
        return response.data.me;
      });
  }
}
```

We specify this class when we initialise `XUIBundle()`:

```tsx
new XUIBundle({
  guardianClass: AppGuardianSmart,
});
```

The `register` calls the `registration` mutation with the GraphQL input: `RegistrationInput`. It's enough to change the input on the server-side by overriding `registration` mutation in `XPasswordBundle`.

However if you want to extend the interface of `Guardian`, meaning you add other methods or add other variables to the existing methods, then besides overriding the `guardianClass` you need to create your own hook, to benefit of autocompletion.

```tsx
const appGuardian = (): AppGuardianSmart => {
  return useGuardian() as AppGuardianSmart;
};
```

## useUISession

useUISession is a hook that allows for handling sessions in a customized manner. The interface that defines the store of the session is the following:

```ts
interface IUISessionStore {
  lastAuthenticationTime: number;
}
```

The hook provides the following methods:

```tsx
get(key); // retrieves a key, e.g. get("lastAuthenticationTime");

set(key, value); // sets a key to a value, e.g. set("lastAuthenticationTime", 0);

onSet(key, (previousValue, newValue) => newValue); // adds a handler that is called on set(key, ...)
// e.g. onSet("lastAuthenticationTime", (previousValue, newValue) => newValue + 1)

onSetRemove(key); // removes the handler, e.g. onSetRemove("lastAuthenticationTime")
```

In order to extend the store and benefit of autocompletion, you have to extend the interface:

```ts title="declarations.ts";
import "@kaviar/x-ui";

declare module "@kaviar/x-ui" {
  export interface IUISessionStore {
    csrfToken: string;
  }
}
```

When initialising `XUIBundle()`, you can pass session defaults:

```ts title="kernel.ts";
  export const kernel = new Kernel({
    ...,
    bundles: [
      ...,
      new XUIBundle({
        sessionDefaults: {
          csrfToken: null
        }
      })
    ]
  })
```

Simple example:

```tsx
import { useUISession, useGuardian } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

function Component() {
  const session = useUISession();
  const guardian = useGuardian()

  guardian
    .login(...)
    .then(() => {
      session.set("lastAuthenticationTime", new Date().getTime() * 1000)
    })

  ...
}
```

## Events

You can use the classic `EventManager` to emit events, but if you want to have a component listen to events during its lifespan (until it gets unmounted), you can use the hook: `useListener`.

```tsx title="Emitting Events"
import { useListener, useEventManager } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

const eventManager = useEventManager();
eventManager.emit(new XEvent());

// The built-in hook lets you listen to events while the component is mounted
useListener(XEvent, (e) => {
  // lives as long as the component lives
});
```

## UI Components

You have the ability to craft and override UI components:

```ts
function Component() {
  const UIComponents = useUIComponents();

  return <UIComponents.Loading />;
}
```

Overriding them is done in the `init()` phase of your bundle

```ts
import { Bundle } from "@kaviar/core";
import { XUIBundle } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

class UIAppBundle extends Bundle {
  async init() {
    const xuiBundle = this.container.get(XUIBundle);
    xuiBundle.updateUIComponents({
      Loading: MyLoadingComponent,
    });
    // Now everywhere it's used it will render it correctly
  }
}
```

Creating new components is done in two steps, first we extend the interface, second we update the components as shown in the overriding phase:

```ts title="defs.ts"
import "@kaviar/x-ui";

declare module "@kaviar/x-ui" {
  export interface IComponents {
    MyCustomOne: React.ComponentType<OptionalPropsType>;
  }
}
```
